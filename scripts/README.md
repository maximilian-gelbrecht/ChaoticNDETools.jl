# Scripts 

These scripts (partially) re-implement the paper in [NJP](https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/abeb90) those [original code](https://github.com/maximilian-gelbrecht/NPDEChaos) is archived in another repository but uses outdated Julia and library version.

# Dependencies 

The scripts use two libraries that are (so far) not in the general registry, please install them from the repositories 

* [NODEData.jl](https://github.com/maximilian-gelbrecht/NODEData.jl) for loading batches of data
* [GinzburgLandau.jl](https://github.com/maximilian-gelbrecht/GinzburgLandau.jl) for the implementation of the Ginzburg Landau equation
